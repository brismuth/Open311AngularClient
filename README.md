Open311AngularClient
====================

This is a responsive Open311 civic issue tracking client built on top of AngularJS. It is fully functional with [fms-endpoint](https://github.com/brismuth/fms-endpoint) as a backend. You can read more about Open311 on [open311.org](http://www.open311.org/about/). 

I chose to build this for an open ended school project because I had no experience with Angular and wanted to get some. I learned a lot!
